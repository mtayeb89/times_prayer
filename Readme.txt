This Python script performs the following tasks:

    Imports required libraries:
        pystyle for styled text and boxes.
        requests for sending HTTP requests.
        BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library for parsing HTML.

    Prints styled text:
        Box.Lines('[+] Learn Python with El-tayeb [+]') prints a box with lines around the text.
        Write.Print('[-] this program for Prayer times', Colors.blue_to_red) prints a styled text message with a color gradient from blue to red.
        Box.DoubleCube('Example []12') prints a box with double cube borders around the text.

    Sets up a user agent:
        user_agent1 is a dictionary that mimics a request from the Firefox browser on Windows.

    Sends an HTTP request:
        r = requests.get('https://timesprayer.com/en/prayer-times-in-cairo.html', headers=user_agent1) sends a GET request to the URL with the user-agent header.

    Parses the HTML response:
        soup = bs(r.content, 'html.parser') creates a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content of the response.

    Extracts prayer times:
        The script finds the prayer times table and extracts the text of each prayer time. The find method locates the table with the class info prayertable mobile, and find_all method retrieves the prayer times rows. Specifically:
            a1 = soup.find(class_='info prayertable mobile').find_all('tr')[1].text extracts the text of the second row (first prayer time).
            a2 = soup.find(class_='info prayertable mobile').find_all('tr')[2].text extracts the text of the third row (second prayer time).
            a3 = soup.find(class_='info prayertable mobile').find_all('tr')[3].text extracts the text of the fourth row (third prayer time).
            a4 = soup.find(class_='info prayertable mobile').find_all('tr')[4].text extracts the text of the fifth row (fourth prayer time).
            a5 = soup.find(class_='info prayertable mobile').find_all('tr')[5].text extracts the text of the sixth row (fifth prayer time).
            a6 = soup.find(class_='info prayertable mobile').find_all('tr')[6].text extracts the text of the seventh row (sixth prayer time).
